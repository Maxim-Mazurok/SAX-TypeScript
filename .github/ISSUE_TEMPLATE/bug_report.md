# General notice
It's best to write a failing test if you find an issue. I will always accept pull requests with failing tests if they demonstrate intended behavior, but it is very hard to figure out what issue you're describing without a test. Writing a test is also the best way for you yourself to figure out if you really understand the issue you think you have with SAX-TypeScript.
-->
